# Predicting Education of Employees using Naive Bayes and Decision Tree
In this project I'm trying to Predicting a Employee Education based on their age, experience, and how much payment they got by looking their Payment Tier.
## The Steps how to predicting the education of a employee
- Step 1 : Read the dataset using pandas.
- Step 2 : print the dataset columns so i can choose what features to use for prediction.
- Step 3 : Assign the X with Age, Experience, and Payment tier.
- Step 4 : Splitting the dataset into 70% train set and 30% test set
- Step 5 : Fit into the model.
- Step 6 : print the accuracy using metrics dependecies.

## Conclusion
Result of Decision Tree Model consistent at 77% accuracy, meanwhile Result of Naive Bayes Model consistent at 75% accuracy, Meaning Decision Tree Model have a slightly superior for predicting employee education rather than Naive Bayes Model.
